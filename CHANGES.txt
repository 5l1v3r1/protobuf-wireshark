-------------------------------

2. Multiple UDP port numbers can be provided in config file

1. Specific dissector now has support for collapsible trees under Wireshark. This
   also gives the ability to filter protobuf messages based on proto field names. 
2. package/wireshark_install_dir parameters in conf file are now optional. They will
   be used if present
3. For specific dissector wireshark/configure.in and wireshark/plugins/Makefile.am neednt
   be modified to contain plugin name etc. The generating script automatically takes
   care of adding the correct entries to each file if not already present.
