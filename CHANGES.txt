Version Runtime Dissector 0.1 (April 04, 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Dissector now parses proto files at runtime. This has made it general so as
   to avoid having to generate a new dissector for each separate message. The old 
   method of generating dissector is still ok(as has problem describe in #2)
   but NO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT is planned. 
2. Fixed problem with dissector when using 64 bit machines.
3. Fix for protobuf int64 types. 
   
Version 0.5 (April 30, 2010)
-------------------------------

1. Fix for dissector crash when dissecting repeated primitive fields. 
2. General code cleanup

Version 0.4 (March 31, 2010)
-------------------------------

1. Fields within protobuf message are mapped to exact position within byte stream
2. Multiple UDP port numbers can be provided in config file

Version 0.3 (March 23, 2010)
-------------------------------

1. Specific dissector now has support for collapsible trees under Wireshark. This
   also gives the ability to filter protobuf messages based on proto field names. 
2. package/wireshark_install_dir parameters in conf file are now optional. They will
   be used if present
3. For specific dissector wireshark/configure.in and wireshark/plugins/Makefile.am neednt
   be modified to contain plugin name etc. The generating script automatically takes
   care of adding the correct entries to each file if not already present.
