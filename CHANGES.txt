1. Specific dissector now has support for collapsible trees under Wireshark. This
   also gives the ability to filter protobuf messages based on proto field names. 
2. package/wireshark_install_dir parameters in conf file are now optional. They will
   be used if present
3. For specific dissector wireshark/configure.in and wireshark/plugins/Makefile.am neednt
   be modified to contain plugin name etc. The generating script automatically takes
   care of adding the correct entries to each file if not already present.
